# Critical Mass Coding Challenge

## Work/Project Examples
### Shovlr - Group Project

https://github.com/MichaelJamesAshworth/Shovlr

Shovlr is an application that allows users to make on-demand snow removal requests for a specified destination.

I was responsible for working on both the back-end and front-end. Specifically for the back-end, I was responsible for, creating database seed data, database helper functions, and routing with Express. My responsibilities for the front-end include the request form and user account pages. I was also tasked with handling user state across multiple components which I did by using useContext rather than prop drilling.


### Scheduler - Solo Project

https://github.com/bluedev773/scheduler

A single-page React application where a user can book, edit, and delete interviews by selecting a time and interviewer. The back-end is done in Express and Postgres for the database. Jest was used for testing purposes.

### Tweeter - Solo Project

https://github.com/bluedev773/tweeter

A simplified single-page Twitter clone using HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX. A user can view the latest tweets as well as create their own with a character limit. Features a responsive design, error handling, and clean design.


## Inspiration

### Flex Box!

Flexbox has truly been a lifesaver for me when it comes to creating responsive and beautiful page layouts. I always use this cheat sheet for flexbox which I have used many times. It is well laid out, easy to understand, has code examples and has embedded codepen visualization. Whenever I am stuck and can't remember how to do something with flexbox I use this page to help me. Not only has it helped me style my pages but I have also used it to try new things and explore different possibilities with my layouts.

### YouTube

I am an avid YouTube watcher. I love watching coding-related channels on different topics from developer lifestyle, interview prep, coding tips, and new technologies. While this isn't one concrete example I take much inspiration from watching videos from these tech creators:

- Mayuko
  - Developer lifestyle
  - General Tips
- Coder Coder
  - Front-end
  - General-Tips
- ThePrimeagen
  - Back-end
  - VIM aficionado
- Many more...

### Dribbble

I use dribbble as a resource if I ever need inspiration in the design phase of a project. Not only do I use it as a tool but the dribbble website itself is a great example of responsive design. It has a clean design and is easy to use on mobile.

## Focus

I would spend my first 6 months at CM trying to master the tech stack that I would be required to use. I would look to get code reviews from other developers so that I can learn best practices and improve my coding skills. I would also seek to build relationships with coworkers and get comfortable in my workspace so that I can become more efficient and effective. I have a few things that I have been meaning to learn or improve on including learning TypeScript, improving with SASS, and improving with testing. I would like to dive right in and start working on a project although I don't have anything specific in mind as to what I would want that project to be.
